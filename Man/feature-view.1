.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B feature-view
is a simple script that plots the subfeatures of a chromosomal feature such
as a gene as a horizontal bar graph.  The input file is a BED file
containing a single feature such as a gene, with subfeatures such as
introns, exons, and UTRs.  Suitable input files are typically generated by
running peak-classifier(1), and then extracting the genes from the resulting
BED file containing augmented GFF features.
